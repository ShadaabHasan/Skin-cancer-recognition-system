# Skin Cancer Recognition System

## Overview

The Skin Cancer Recognition System is a computer vision project aimed at aiding in detection of skin cancer through automated analysis of skin lesion images. By leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, this system provides an efficient and non-invasive tool for identifying potential skin cancer risks, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and public health.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances quality of skin lesion images for better analysis.
- **Machine Learning Classification**: Utilizes algorithms like CNNs and SVMs for accurate classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows easy upload of images for quick feedback on malignancy likelihood.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides instant results and recommendations for further action.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, SeaBorn, Scikit-learn, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, math

## Project Structure

- **/models**: Pre-trained machine learning models for skin cancer detection.
- **/images**: Sample images for testing.
- **app.py**: Main application script.
- **preprocessing.py**: Image preprocessing and feature extraction functions.
- **classification.py**: Machine learning and deep learning model implementations.
